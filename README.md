The Racket Guide
===

I am working my way through [The Racket Guide][racket-guide]. The goal is to
learn more about contracts and metaprogramming. Currently, all the code exists
in [racket-guide.rkt](./racket-guide.rkt) but I'll likely start splitting stuff
out when I get further along.

Notes
---

- Using `LOOKUP:` to define things which would be worth looking up in the
  future.
